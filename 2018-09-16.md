> The purpose of the software life cycle is to optimize “time to value”; to effectively convert ideas into working products and services for customers.

> By combining all of these ideas together, we arrived at a model where a development team, equipped with amazing developer productivity tools, is responsible for the full software life cycle: design, development, test, deploy, operate, and support.

> A full cycle developer thinks and acts like an SWE, SDET, and SRE.
